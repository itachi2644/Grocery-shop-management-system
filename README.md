# Grocery-shop-management-system
The code provided is a Python script for a Grocery Shop Management System. 
The script uses the MySQL Connector to connect to a local MySQL database and then prompts the user to enter a login or exit choice. 
If the user chooses to login, they are asked to provide a username and password.
If the login credentials are correct, the program displays a menu of different options for managing the grocery shop.
The menu options include uploading customer details, worker details, and product details to the database, updating existing records, showing all customer, worker, and product details, checking stock availability, updating total stock availability, uploading profit and loss details per day, and checking the salary details of each worker.
The code includes various input prompts and loops to allow the user to input multiple records at once. It also includes MySQL commands for inserting, updating, and retrieving data from the database.
